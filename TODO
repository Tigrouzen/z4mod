TODO:

- test JFS support
- z4mod: check the lazy_itable_init option
- z4mod: Better backup - dump rfs partition as image, 
         mount as loop to restore data, dump using redbend_ua/dd for recovery.
         It adds a bit of complexity to the code (loop), but _much_ more safe.
         OR format the rfs partition back, and restore the tar normally...
- z4build: change kernel cmdline to start /z4mod instead of /init
- z4build: add zip support along with the tar to -t option
- Release final version (1.0) only after all TODOs are completed
