z4mod has been created to correct a mistake Samsung has made on their line of 
Android devices: The RFS filesystem.

The RFS filesystem is a filesystem that attempts to attach metadata onto the 
ageing FAT standard. This is the filesystem that was used in MS DOS. It has a 
number of issues, such as requiring linux file metadata to be placed inside 
seperate files and a very single threaded and badly optimized driver. This 
leads to strange pauses while using Samsung devices, and a general sluggish 
feel to operations involving 'disk' access. By changing these partitions to 
different filesystems, nearly all of these pauses, and the sluggish behaviour, 
is eliminated.

z4mod is a set of two seperate utilities:

+ An automated kernel patch that will allow the kernel to mount partitions to 
  filesystems other than RFS.
+ Android recovery scripts to convert the partitions from RFS to other 
  filesystems - "update.zip" files.

The online kernel patcher aims to allow anyone without any knowledge of linux 
the ability to patch a devices kernel in a simple manner. It will also allow 
for customized update.zip files to be created with an easy to use web 
interface.
