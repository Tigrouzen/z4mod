z4mod started as a modest idea - as  a new Android user I wanted to ditch RFS in
favor of  a real filesystem. But  thanks to the  great support of XDA  users and
testers, z4mod  grew and evolved, and  it is now  a very ambitious project  - To
allow any  kernel be rooted, patched, customized,  and yes - replace  RFS with a
filesystem of your choice. z4mod aim  is to provide standards to the choatic SGS
platform.

z4mod is a set of two seperate utilities:

+ An  automated kernel patch that will  allow the kernel to  mount partitions to
  filesystems  other  than RFS.
+ Android   recovery  scripts  to  convert  the partitions  from  RFS  to  other
  filesystems - "update.zip" files.

The online  kernel patcher aims to  allow anyone without any  knowledge of linux
the ability to patch a devices kernel in a simple manner. It will also allow for
customized update.zip files to be created with an easy to use web interface.

Howto use:


  Patching the kernel.

To patch a zImage file and enable non-RFS mounts on it, use:

$ ./z4build

The above command will show you the usage help. Usually you will use z4build
like this:

$ ./z4build zImage recovery root

The above command will patch the zImage kernel, and add a new recovery binary,
followed by adding 'root' functionality to the zImage.



  Creating update.zip for converting. 

To create update.zip file use:

$ ./z4zipgen.sh

This will show you the usage help. Usually you will use z4zipgen.sh
like this:

$ ./z4zipgen.sh ext2 root busybox

This will create an update.zip file which will convert the RFS filesystem to
ext2 and install root and busybox to the target system.
